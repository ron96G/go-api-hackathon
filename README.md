# Go Hackathon

## What's Inside?

A sample repository for a Go Hackathon. 
The goal of this repository is to provide an entrypoint for developers to learn Go and OpenAPI by building a simple REST API and CLI tool.
The hackathon is designed to be completed in a few hours, with a focus on learning and building.

The hackathon starts with an intro to Go and OpenAPI (see [intro](INTRO.md)).

The hackathon project is seperated into levels (see [.levels](.levels)):
- Level 1-3 (easy, 1h+)
- Level 4 (medium, <1h)
- Level 5 (hard, 1h+)
