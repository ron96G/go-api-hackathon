# Go Hackathon

## Agenda

- Intro
    - Why Go and what are its key features?
    - Why OpenAPI and why is it useful?
- Level-Overview
    - Level 1-3 (easy, 1h+)
    - Level 4 (medium, <1h)
    - Level 5 (hard, 1h+)

## Goal

- learn to use OpenAPI with Go to auto-generate API code, 
- build a running service and client
- add middleware, persistence, 
- and deployment.


## Intro

Brief intro. For more info asks some AI assistant.

### Go

- Go is a 
    - statically typed
    - (statically) compiled programming language 
    - designed for simplicity and efficiency.
- It is known for its 
    - concurrency support, 
    - garbage collection, 
    - good toolchain,
    - fast compilation times,
    - strong standard library
    - and explicit error handling.
- It is widely used for cloud-native applications like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and more.


### OpenAPI

- OpenAPI is a specification for defining RESTful APIs.
- Originally known as Swagger
- It allows you to describe your API in a machine-readable format (YAML/JSON).
    - This enables auto-generation of client and server code, API documentation, and mocks.
    - It is language-agnostic.
    - Easy to understand - also for non-developers.
- It is widely used in the industry and has a large ecosystem of tools and libraries.
    - It also is the standard at DT.
    - Tools like [spectral](https://developer.telekom.de/docs/src/api_linting_documentation/9_tools/linting/) and [swagger-ui](https://developer.telekom.de/swagger-editor/) are widely used.

- It is supported by many programming languages, including Go.
